                <p>I enjoy seeing a solution materialize from ideas on a whiteboard to a working system in production and the satisfaction of knowing that the ideas work, and make the work of others easier and more efficient. Programming is a perfect craft for achieving this, and ever since the first program I wrote (It would tell you if it is Thursday or not) in Turbo Pascal's nostalgic yellow on blue IDE, I knew this is what I want to do. 
                <br/><br/>
                I am a software developer with over 15 years of experience in the field. I specialize in backend development, but have also worked on projects that involve front end development. I have experience in all phases of the SDLC, from clarifying requirements, to implementation, integration with other systems to automation of testing and monitoring of the solution. 
                    
                I am also drawn to this field because one can never stop learning. There is always something new to explore, be it a language, a paradigm, a new framework. </p>

                <h3>Backend Developer</h3>
                <p class="duration-subtitle">September 2007 - Present</p>
                <p>The current project worked on allows transactions originating from the front end to be processed
                    straight through without requiring human intervention. This involves building the
                    micro services, databases and BPMN workflows that enable this as well as integrating with many of
                    the other systems
                    that are needed to process a transaction, such as the CRM system, the account management system, and
                    api's developed by other domains.
                    <br /><br />
                    Other projects include:<br />
                    Astute interface: Design and implementation of system that allowed Astute (external financial data
                    aggregation company) to obtain investment information from Allan Gray.
                    <br /><br />
                    Communication Engine: Batch and on demand processing system used to gather data, generate and send
                    out client communication of any kind to clients. This ranges from SMS notifications to monthly
                    statements to transaction confirmations and tax certificates.
                    <br /><br />
                    Digital Authorization: Design and implementation of solution that allowed brokers to submit
                    transactions on client's behalf and obtain authorization from the client digitally without the need to
                    fill out forms.
                    <br /><br />

                    The Domains System: A system for coordinating interaction between the numerous 3rd party
                    systems used at the company.

                <p class="duration-subtitle">December 2005 - September 2007</p>
                <p>I worked on the design and implementation of an Electricity meter management system. I was
                    responsible for the mobile subsystem of the project. This included building the software to be used
                    on Windows Mobile devices, and building the back end services the devices would communicate with, and
                    the implementation of the interface to the RF unit used for communication with the physical meter.
                    <br /><br />
                    The mobile devices used custom built RF hardware to gather information about the meter installed at
                    a location. They would be used to scan meter serial numbers, capture GPS co-ordinates and capture
                    readings from the meter, this would be uploaded the central server.
                    <br /><br />
                    This has exposed me to a number of cutting edge technologies at the time such as the .net
                    compact framework, interfacing with GPS hardware, Bluetooth and RF communication.
                    I have also gained significant experience in higher level aspects of system design.

                <p>I was involved in the development of the client side application of the Kinetic Mobile marketing system. The
                    application was written in C# for the .net compact framework, and intended for use on Windows CE
                    mobile devices. The application allowed sales agents to place orders and manage stock using their
                    mobile device.
                    <br /><br />
                    This project has exposed me to the .net mobile framework.

                <p>I worked on the development of an electronic payment (EFT) system.
                    Initially I was responsible for implementing translators for certain ATM machines. More
                    recently I have been working on the cryptographic subsystem of the EFT platform.
                    <br /><br />
                    This job has given me opportunity to work on complex computer software, it has also exposed
                    me to tasks involved in developing extremely robust systems such as proper design, unit testing
                    and component testing. All development was done in C#.
                    Reason for leaving: The company was liquidated due to lack of funds.

                    at various legal institutions, to one central location. This makes the data available to a wide
                    variety of user in a very short time.
                    <br /><br />
                    The most recent project consisted of implementing an internet portal for Windeed that allows users to perform deeds office searches through a web site. C# and ASP.NET were used for the implementation.
