                <h3>Backend Developer</h3>
                <p class="duration-subtitle">September 2007 - Present</p>
                <p>During this time I have worked on numerous projects at Allan Gray:
                    The Domains System: A system for coordinating interaction between the numerous 3rd party
                    systems
                    used at the company.<br /><br />

                    Asisa project: Extraction and aggregation of fund information from data sources within the
                    company for upload to ASISA.
                    Astute interface: Design of components to be used to allow Astute to access Allan Gray Data.
                    <br /><br />
                    Communication Engine: This is an in house system used to gather data, generate and send out
                    client communication of any kind to Allan Gray clients. This ranges from sms notifications
                    to
                    monthly statements, transaction confirmations and tax certificates.
                    <br /><br />
                    Digital Authorization solution
                    <br /><br />
                    Complex Transactions: Allowing transactions originating from the front end to be processed
                    straight through to the end instead of requiring human interaction. Building the
                    microservices,
                    databases and bpmn workflows that enable this. Integrating with many of the other systems
                    that
                    are needed to process a transaction, such as the CRM system, the account management system,
                    message queueing subsystem.
                    <br /><br />
                    Migrating of architecture from monolith to micro services. From C# to Scala and Golang.
                    Implementing monitoring and alerting using tools such as Grafana, Prometheus, Graylog and
                    Pagerduty.
                    Gitlab, Docker, Kubernetes, Gitlab CD\CI.

                <h3>Developer \ Architect</h3>
                <p class="duration-subtitle">December 2005 - September 2007</p>
                <p>Member of a team of 3 responsible for the design and implementation of an Electricity meter
                    management system for our client. I was responsible for the mobile subsystem of the project.
                    This included building the software to be used on Windows Mobile devices, the
                    web services the devices would communicate with, and the interface to the RF unit used for
                    communication with the physical meter.
                    <br /><br />
                    The mobile devices used RF hardware to gather information about the meter installed at the
                    location.
                    They would be used to scan meter serial numbers, capture GPS co-ordinates and other
                    information,
                    take pictures of the installation, and upload this to the central server.
                    <br /><br />
                    This has exposed me to a number of cutting edge technologies at the time such as the .net
                    compact framework,
                    interfacing with GPS hardware, Bluetooth and GPRS communication as well as RF communication.
                    I
                    have also gained significant experience in higher level aspects of system design.

                <p>Development of the client side application of the Kinetic Mobile marketing system. The
                    application was written in C# for the .net compact framework, and intended for use on Windows CE
                    mobile
                    devices.The application allowed sales agents to place orders and manage merchandise using their

                    The job has exposed me to the .net mobile framework.

                <p>Work done here was part of the development of an electronic fund transfer (EFT) system.
                    Initially I was responsible for implementing translators for certain ATM machines. More
                    recently I have been working on the cryptographic subsystem of the EFT platform.
                    <br /><br />
                    This job has given me opportunity to work on complex computer software, it has also exposed
                    me to tasks involved in developing extremely robust systems such as proper design, unit testing
                    and component testing. All development was done in C#.
                    Reason for leaving: The company was liquidated due to lack of funds.

                    <br /><br />
                    My most recent project consisted of implementing an internet portal for Windeed that will

                    implementation tools.
